This is currently a sample autobio.

I was born in CA and spent 3 years there before my parents got a divorce and my mother, brother and I moved to Oregon to be closer to my mother's family.
I lived in Oregon from ages 3 to 6 in a town called The Dalles, Oregon. After that, I moved across the Columbia River to Lyle, WA where I lived for the coming 3 years.
During this time, I attended Kindergarten through Second grade at a tiny country elementary school. I remember riding the bus for an hour and a half every morning and evening to commute to and from school.
